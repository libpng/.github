`libpng` is an incredibly important dependency for a lot of projects, but from
what I can tell, no longer has active maintainers. Therefore, I decided to
fork it. I welcome your contributions to the future health of `libpng`.

If you are interested in helping out, I welcome people who are interested in
contributing and maintaining `libpng`.
